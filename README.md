MuckRock API
============

This repository presents a collection of scripts demonstrating the MuckRock API. Find more information on [filing requests in bulk](https://muckrock.notion.site/Guides-and-Manuals-9852bdcb6046454f80840a3f833fd95c) on our Notion guide. 

The API has a [visual interface](https://www.muckrock.com/api_v1/), but it is most powerful when accessed programmatically.

To access the API, you must first get your API token, which is [currently available on your profile page](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/) (scroll to the bottom left). The key is generated from your MuckRock user account and password. If you don't have an account, [sign up here](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/register).
