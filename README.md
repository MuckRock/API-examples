MuckRock API
============

This repository presents a collection of scripts demonstrating the MuckRock API.

The API has a [visual interface](https://www.muckrock.com/api_v1/), but it is most powerful when accessed programmatically.

To access the API, you must first get your API token, which is [currently available on your profile page](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/) (scroll to the bottom left). The key is generated from your MuckRock user account and password. If you don't have an account, [sign up here](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/register).
